# OutThere Public code repo
This is a git repo that we can keep code for things like the comms demo setup.

I have uploaded this repo to the google drive because you can download it and use it without needing set it up.
This may not be that useful but It might be?  To use: download folder from drive into your local machine, then set upi your user details.  (Modify this file, then do 'git commit -m "<mesage>" --all', and git should tell you how to set these up.)
Make sure you run git pull origin after downloading.
